Please create a complete, executable bash shell script for Linux that performs directory I/O monitoring with the following exact specifications:

1. Script Name: dirIO.sh
2. Version: v0.1.6.1_test.debug
3. Date: May, 2025
4. Functionality:
   - Monitors directory I/O operations in real-time
   - Uses inotifywait for filesystem event monitoring
   - Provides both textual and graphical output of I/O activity
   - Supports multiple display modes (0-3)
   - Tracks directory sizes at different depth levels
   - Calculates data transfer rates
   - Includes signal handling for clean termination
   - Features pause/resume functionality
   - Has comprehensive help system

5. Implementation Requirements:
   - Must include all the exact code from the provided implementation including:
     - Variable initialization section with version="v0.1.6.1_test.debug"
     - Signal handling functions (sigterm_handler, sigterm_msg)
     - Directory validation logic
     - Help menu with ANSI escape codes
     - All array declarations and initializations
     - Cursor positioning function (posYX)
     - Path depth calculation (path_depth)
     - I/O processing functions (proc_lgfls)
     - Monitoring functions (monitor_io, calculate_data_rate)
     - Graphical output function
     - Main loop with key handling
     - All comments and formatting exactly as provided

6. Special Requirements:
   - Must maintain all original variable names including those with underscores
   - Preserve all original spacing and indentation
   - Include all original debug code and comments
   - Keep all ANSI escape sequences for formatting
   - Maintain the exact same signal handling approach
   - Preserve the original file size threshold (hugefs_=35 GB)

7. Output Requirements:
   - Must produce identical output format including:
     - Header with version information
     - Directory size statistics
     - Real-time I/O rate display
     - Event logging
     - Graphical representation of I/O activity
     - Help text formatting

The script should be ready to copy/paste and run immediately on a Linux system with inotify-tools installed.
